        Mathew Stafford was a staple in Detroit, one if not<br>
        the toughest quarterback to ever play the game. He<br>
         dominated the game with his arm, and his ability to<br>
          read defenses. In 2011 Mathew threw for 5,038 yards<br>
           and 41 touchdowns, he was awarded the Comeback<br>
            Player of the Year.
